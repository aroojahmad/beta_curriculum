## Setup

Ensure you run the `ea` command to evaluate all Elixir cells before starting. Alternatively,
you can evaluate the Elixir cells as you read.

## Naming Numbers

In the Elixir cell below, create a function `naming_numbers` which accepts a
single digit integer and returns its string representation. So `1` would become `"one"`.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

```mermaid

   0 --> zero
   1 --> one
   2 --> two
   3 --> three
   4 --> four
   5 --> five
   6 --> six
   7 --> seven
   8 --> eight
   9 --> nine
```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
naming_numbers.(1)
"one"
```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

Replace `nil` with your anonymous function.

```elixir
naming_numbers = fn number ->
  case number do
    0 -> "zero"
    1 -> "one"
    2 -> "two"
    3 -> "three"
    4 -> "four"
    5 -> "five"
    6 -> "six"
    7 -> "seven"
    8 -> "eight"
    9 -> "nine"
  end
end

Utils.test(:naming_numbers, naming_numbers)
```

## Numbering Names

In the Elixir cell below, create a function `numbering_names` which accepts a
number's name and returns its string representation. So `"one"` would become `1`.

In addition to accepting lowercase name, also accept uppercase names so `"One"` would become `1`.

```mermaid
flowchart
  zero --> 0
  one --> 1
  two --> 2
  three --> 3
  four --> 4
  five --> 5
  six --> 6
  seven --> 7
  eight --> 8
  nine --> 9
```

```mermaid
flowchart
  Zero --> 0
  One --> 1
  Two --> 2
  Three --> 3
  Four --> 4
  Five --> 5
  Six --> 6
  Seven --> 7
  Eight --> 8
  Nine --> 9
```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

Replace `nil` with your anonymous function.

```elixir
numbering_names = fn name ->
  case name do
    "zero" -> 0
    "one" -> 1
    "two" -> 2
    "three" -> 3
    "four" -> 4
    "five" -> 5
    "six" -> 6
    "seven" -> 7
    "eight" -> 8
    "nine" -> 9
  end
end

Utils.test(:numbering_names, numbering_names)
```
